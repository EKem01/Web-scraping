Scraping and Analyzing Basketball Statistics with Python

In this Jupyter notebook, I created the following:
1. Defined a web scraping function
2. Returned a dictionary corresponding to the regular season statistics of each basketball player scraped from en.wikipedia.org.
3. The parameter or input link is the URL of the Wikipedia page of each of the players selected.
4. I web-scraped the Data and converted the links to Pandas Dataframe.
5. I used the Data to plot the points per game for a player using the function plt.plot().
